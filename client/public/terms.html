    </ul>

    <h2>4. Limitations of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall G-Invoice or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on G-Invoice’s website or application, even if G-Invoice or a G-Invoice authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.</p>
