    <h3>2.1 Tax Compliance & Estimation Tools</h3>
    <p>If you choose to use our Tax Estimation features ("Compliance Shield"), G-Invoice processes your revenue and expense data to provide estimated tax liability figures. <strong>Important:</strong> This processing is performed to give you internal business insights. G-Invoice does <strong>not</strong> automatically share, report, or transmit your financial data or tax estimates to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) or any other government tax authority, except where strictly required by a valid court order or law enforcement request.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is securely stored on cloud servers located in the <strong>European Union (Amsterdam)</strong>. We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information and business data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We engage third-party companies to facilitate our service ("Service Providers"). specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Paystack:</strong> We use Paystack for payment processing. We do not store your credit card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.</p>
